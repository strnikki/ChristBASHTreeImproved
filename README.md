# ChristBASHTreeImproved

A fork of https://github.com/sergiolepore/ChristBASHTree with a few tweaks, like the adding options for customizing the tree and lights.

One major difference is that in this version the tree decorations are generated a single time. 

As usual, this is a WIP and PRs are welcome :)
